I believe that data is not just for decision-makers — it’s for nation builders. This project is my small way of showcasing how analytics can help organizations like PTDF amplify their impact, evaluate their reach, and promote transparency.
I hope this inspires other analysts, policymakers, and aspiring scholars to use data for good — and recognize the incredible work PTDF is doing in building capacity, transforming lives, and empowering Nigeria’s future.
